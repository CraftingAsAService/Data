I'm usually in charge of how the interface looks and feels, but this time around I was also fortunate enough to be involved with light and shadow adjustments for background maps.","As he did for A Realm Reborn, Yoshitaka Amano created both the logo silhouette and concept art for Heavensward. ...And he also threw in a bonus piece above and beyond what we asked for.","This bonus art can be seen in the collector's edition─the shiny, silver illustration. It's a cool piece, and I highly recommend you check it out. Thanks for stopping by! I hope you continue to enjoy the game for a long time to come!"]}],"equipment":[{"id":8704},{"id":11962,"dye":6},{"id":9970},{"id":9285}]},"partials":[{"type":"item","id":"8704","obj":{"i":8704,"n":"リムレスグラス","l":1,"c":5142,"t":34}},{"type":"item","id":"11962","obj":{"i":11962,"n":"ラミークラフターダブレット","l":100,"c":6887,"t":35,"p":15444}},{"type":"item","id":"9970","obj":{"i":9970,"n":"ピカルーン・スカウトトラウザー","l":100,"c":5691,"t":36}},{"type":"item","id":"9285","obj":{"i":9285,"n":"ベストマンゲイター","l":1,"c":5503,"t":38,"p":6000}}]}
