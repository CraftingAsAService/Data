Forming the main thrust, the Immortal Flames will strike at the stronghold with all their strength, though this is but a feint. While the garrison's eyes are drawn outwards, you and your comrades must steal past its defenses and attempt to deactivate the magitek field which protects the Praetorium, the fortress within a fortress wherein the Ultima Weapon is believed to be housed.","id":15,"patch":2.0,"categoryIcon":61801,"time":120,"min_lvl":50,"fullIcon":112016,"healer":2,"tank":2,"ranged":2,"melee":2,"max_lvl":50,"min_ilvl":42,"fights":[{"currency":[{"id":28,"amount":100}],"type":"Boss","mobs":[14380000002118]}],"coffers":[{"items":[4554,4558,4560],"coords":[15.2,8.0]},{"items":[4554,4558,4560],"coords":[11.5,13.5]},{"items":[4554,4558,4560],"coords":[12.2,6.4]},{"items":[4554,4558,4560],"coords":[10.9,10.9]}],"rewards":[9802],"currency":[{"id":28,"amount":100}],"unlockedByQuest":66672},"partials":[{"type":"mob","id":"14380000002118","obj":{"i":14380000002118,"n":"Livia Sas Junius","l":"50","z":260,"t":null}},{"type":"item","id":"4554","obj":{"i":4554,"n":"X-Potion","l":70,"c":2660,"t":44,"p":887}},{"type":"item","id":"4558","obj":{"i":4558,"n":"X-Ether","l":70,"c":2663,"t":44,"p":1108}},{"type":"item","id":"4560","obj":{"i":4560,"n":"Hi-Elixir","l":70,"c":2665,"t":44}},{"type":"item","id":"9802","obj":{"i":9802,"n":"Livia sas Junius Card","l":1,"c":5779,"t":86}},{"type":"quest","id":"66672","obj":{"i":66672,"n":"Rock the Castrum","g":1,"l":46,"s":248}}]}
