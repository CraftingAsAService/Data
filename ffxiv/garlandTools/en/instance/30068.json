{"instance":{"name":"The Ridorana Lighthouse","category":"Raids","description":"South of Rabanastre, in a remote corner of the Valnard Sea gapes a fathomless maw that, for centuries, has slowly devoured the world around it: Ridorana. Whether you believe the cataract natural wonder or demon-torn gate to the very underworld, journeys to her edge should be made with the utmost caution, seeing as none who have stumbled into the darkness have ever returned to tell their tale. An ancient spire once used by the Dalmascans as a lighthouse rises defiantly above the churning waters to warn forethoughtful and foolhardy alike. It is into this spire that the transformed Ba'Gamnan has fled. It is into this hell that you must follow.","id":30068,"patch":4.3,"categoryIcon":61802,"time":120,"min_lvl":70,"fullIcon":112286,"healer":2,"tank":1,"ranged":2,"melee":3,"max_lvl":70,"min_ilvl":335,"unlockedByQuest":68628},"partials":[{"type":"quest","id":"68628","obj":{"i":68628,"n":"Annihilation","g":15,"l":2404,"s":60,"f":1}}]}
