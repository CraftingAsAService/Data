It was Guildmaster Fufucha─her skill, her knowledge, and her love for the trees most of all─who gave this forest new life.","Were it not for her, I would not be here today. Nay...like as not, I would never have chosen the botanist's path. The profound joy and satisfaction that my life's work has brought me─I owe it all to her.","If I have served in my own humble way to restore Fufucha's faith in her profession, it is the very least I could have done after all that she has imparted to me.","Verily, there is much I would still learn from my mentor. I can but hope she will grace these bleak highlands with her presence once more."]},{"questid":67584,"lines":["Lest you wonder, Basyle and I trained as botanists together.
